# Git Commit Message Guidelines

When creating a commit message, please follow these guidelines to ensure clarity and consistency across the project:

1. **Structure of Commit Message**:
    - The commit message should consist of a header, a body (optional), and a footer (optional).
    - The header should be a single line that summarizes the changes made.
    - If necessary, the body can provide additional context or details about the changes.
    - The footer can include references to issues or breaking changes.
