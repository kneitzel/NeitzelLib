/**
 * The InjectingFXMLLoader class provides a custom implementation of JavaFX's FXMLLoader
 * that supports dependency injection. It facilitates the loading of FXML files while
 * dynamically injecting dependencies into controllers during the loading process.
 *
 * This class utilizes the InjectingControllerFactory to enable seamless integration
 * of dependency injection with JavaFX controllers. Dependencies can be added to the
 * controller factory, and the loader will use this factory to instantiate controllers
 * with the appropriate dependencies.
 *
 * Features of this loader include:
 * - Support for dependency injection into JavaFX controllers by using a custom factory.
 * - Adding custom dependency mappings at runtime.
 * - Scanning and initializing injectable components from a specified package.

     * required objects during controller instantiation. It plays a critical role in enabling seamless
     * integration of dependency injection with JavaFX's {@link FXMLLoader}.

     * The `controllerFactory` is used internally by the {@link InjectingFXMLLoader} to provide a consistent
     * and extensible mechanism for controller creation while maintaining loose coupling and enhancing testability.
     *
     * Key responsibilities:
     * - Manages a mapping of classes to their injectable instances required for controller instantiation.
     * - Dynamically analyzes and invokes appropriate constructors for controllers based on the availability
     *   of dependencies.
     * - Ensures that controllers are created with required dependencies, preventing manual resolution of injections.
     *
     * This variable is initialized in the {@link InjectingFXMLLoader} and can be extended with additional
     * mappings at runtime using relevant methods.
