 * of bindings, allowing developers to track or adjust the linked properties
 * dynamically.
 *
 * The internal list of bindings is implemented as an {@link ObservableList},
 * allowing property change notifications to be easily monitored for UI
 * updates or other reactive behaviors.
 *
 * This class serves as an organizational component and does not provide
