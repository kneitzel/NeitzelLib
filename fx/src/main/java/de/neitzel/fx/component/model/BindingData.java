 * The Binding class represents a connection between a source and a target,

 * - direction: Represents the type of the binding. Defaults to "unidirectional".
 * - source: Represents the source of the binding.
 * - target: Represents the target of the binding.
 *
 * It uses JavaFX property types, allowing these properties to be observed
