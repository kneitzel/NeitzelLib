# JavaFX Maven Project

Example Maven Project for a JavaFX Application.

**Update**: Added profile fatjar

**Update**: Added reporting to create a site (html documentation of project)

**Update**: Java 21 is now fully supported

This projects includes multiple plugins:
- Build of an App-Image using JPackage (Profile: image)
- Build of an fat jar (Profile: fatjar)
- Use of Maven Wrapper
- Static code analysis with PMD and Spotbugs
- Check of dependency updates during build
- JavaFX plugin to start application

**Requirements**
To use this Template, all you need is a local Java Installation. 
My current advice is to use a long term supported (LTS) version of either Java 17 or Java 21.
