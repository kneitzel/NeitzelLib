# NeitzelLib Maven Project

## A Java Utilities Library

This repository is **not** a production-ready library, but rather a loose collection of small helpers, utilities, and ideas that might come in handy for Java developers.

The code in this project is intended as a **starting point** or **inspiration** for your own solutions. It is often easier to copy and adapt individual classes as needed instead of using the whole library as a dependency.

Feel free to explore, copy, modify, and improve whatever you find useful.

> ⚠️ Use at your own discretion — no guarantees of stability, backwards compatibility, or completeness.
