# NeitzelLib Maven Project

## A Java Utilities Library

This repository is **not** a production-ready library, but rather a personal collection of small helpers, utilities, and ideas that I find useful or interesting as a Java developer.

It serves primarily as a **knowledge base** and **inspiration pool** for my own development work. You're welcome to explore, copy, modify, or improve whatever you find helpful.
